The USB-Switchblade


Purpose:
	Provide a platform for pen testers to automate scripts to retrieve important data about their target and provide a cheap solution without the use of specialized HIDs.


Information:
	This project was originally written in batch, but my be transfered to python in the near future. Feel free to modify the project to correct issues you come across. Additional modules are also welcome in this project, but remember to change their file name to *.bat.txt to avoid automatic execution. Files with *.bat.txt.wip are either not working, incomplete, or never tested.


Items that need to be fixed:
	-Change the modules that copy files from "%Drive%" to "<project root>\all\%computername%" so that it works on C: drive as well


Additional Information:
	The following project was a collaberation project with Austin during our Data Center class. This project is for informational purposes or for pen testers with authorization from the owner of the equiptment.
